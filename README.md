-> Since the voter id of the person is not available in time to solve this issue , e-adhar of the person should be 
   linked with blockchain so as soon as person reaches the age of 18 his/her e-voter id card will be created.
    
-> We can create an app where each participating candidate profile will be treat as a block, where its all previous past records
   like attendance in the House, Criminal Record, Fund Utilization, Number of Debates participated in,
   Promises made vs. Promises Kept,etc. will be updated on daily basis in the nearby future using blockchain.
   So, it will provide the people to see their past performances to decide wisely and
   have a clear discrepany over all the users for the upcoming elections.
   
-> Let assume if a hacker tries to hack some politician profile(a block) and change the data,
   one has to go through the other blocks too. So, super security driven by immutability.

-> All the computers will be linked through blockchain during voting and casted votes will be counted simultaneously,
   in this way the results can be declared as soon as the counting gets over.
